# Morse Code Overview

## What is Morse Code?
Morse code is a method of encoding textual information using sequences of dots (`.`) and dashes (`-`). Each character—letters, numbers, and punctuation—is represented by a unique combination of these signals. Originally designed for auditory transmission, Morse code can also be conveyed visually or through touch.

## Historical Context
Developed in the early 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail, Morse code was created to enable long-distance communication via telegraph systems. It revolutionized how messages were sent across continents, especially in maritime, military, and aviation contexts. Its simplicity and reliability made it indispensable before the rise of modern digital communication.

## How It Works
The Morse code system assigns each character a specific pattern of dots and dashes:
- A dot represents a short signal.
- A dash represents a longer signal.
- Characters are separated by spaces, and words are divided by longer pauses.

For example:
- `A` is `.−`
- `B` is `−...`
- `SOS` (a distress signal) is `... --- ...`

Morse code can be transmitted through sound (beeps), light (flashes), or even physical taps—making it versatile across many mediums.
